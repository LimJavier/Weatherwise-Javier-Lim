Any parting comments on your learning experience?

This was my first time working on a Python project to build a weather advisor application in Google Colab. To be honest, I was worried about how to complete this assignment, since I did not fully understand the project requirements. However, as I progressed, I found that the resources in the Weatherwise assignment are very helpful and detailed. It not only includes the assignment summary but also provides valuable information, such as explanations on the whole assignment structure and how to work with AI tools in the development process. In particular, I used different AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek to assist me in completing my Weatherwise assignment. These AI tools provided me with impressive ideas on how to improve the code and functions, and suggested various solutions to solve the issues I encountered. However, I understand that simply asking for coding solutions can result in academic misconduct. Hence, I followed the assignment instructions on how to use the prompting techniques to guide the AI rather than asking for a complete solution directly. For instance, I identified errors from the initial AI-generated code and followed up with specific requests for improvements with clear objectives. Besides that, I requested pseudocode from the AI before implementing the function to ensure the logic behind it aligned with my objectives. These measures not only enhance my learning process but also show my understanding of the code. Although I still faced many issues when running the program, I am really proud of myself because I managed to guide the AI to generate solutions that aligned with my expectations. For instance, I found that some functions did not provide accurate error messages for invalid locations or API issues, so I prompted the AI to improve the specific error handling to ensure the users received clear feedback when something went wrong. If I had more time, I would also like to improve the functionality of the weather program, such as adding extra features like showing the weather forecasts for multiple cities at the same time or customising the graph visualisations. Overall, I am very satisfied with my work, although I acknowledge that there are still many areas to improve. This programming assignment has been a valuable learning experience for me to understand how enjoyable coding can be. I was pleasantly surprised that I could build my own weather application that can provide useful feedback based on real-time weather data. Last but not least, this learning experience has increased my confidence in using Python in my future projects, and I am looking forward to building more applications practically!
